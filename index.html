    <p>Gaza is ruled by <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Hamas">Hamas</a> , <i>an Islamist group which is committed to the destruction of Israel and is designated as a terrorist group by the UK and many other countries.</i>  Hamas won the Palestinians' last elections in 2006, and seized control of Gaza the following year by ousting the rival <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Fatah">Fatah</a> movement of West Bank-based President <b>Mahmoud Abbas</b>. Since then, militants in Gaza have fought several wars with Israel, which along with Egypt has maintained a partial blockade on the strip to isolate Hamas and try to stop attacks, particularly the indiscriminate firing of rockets towards Israeli cities. Palestinians in Gaza say Israel's restrictions and its air strikes on heavily populated areas amount to collective punishment. This year has been the deadliest year on record for Palestinians in the occupied West Bank and East Jerusalem. They also complain of the restrictions and military actions being carried out there in response to deadly attacks on Israelis. These tensions could have been one of the reasons for Hamas's latest attack. But the militants may also have been seeking to boost their popularity among ordinary Palestinians, including by using hostages to pressure Israel to free some of the estimated 4,500 Palestinians held in its <a href="https://apnews.com/article/palestinians-israel-prisoner-exchange-hostage-92545883b1fef86fb9b34549b7deca58">prisons</a>.</p>
<hr>
    <p>The <b>US</b>, the <b>European Union</b> and <b>other Western countries</b> have <b>all</b> condemned the Hamas attack on Israel. <a href="https://www.axios.com/2023/11/04/us-israel-aid-military-funding-chart">The US, Israel's closest ally, </a> has over the years given the Jewish state more than $260bn in military and economic aid, and has promised additional equipment, air defence missiles, guided bombs and ammunition.It has also sent two aircraft carrier strike groups to the eastern Mediterranean to deter Israel's enemies, particularly Lebanon's <a href="https://www.cfr.org/backgrounder/what-hezbollah">Hezbollah</a> movement, from opening a second front in the war. Russia and China have both refused to condemn Hamas, and say they are maintaining contact with both sides in the conflict. Russian President Vladimir Putin has blamed US policy for the absence of peace in the Middle East. Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, is a key supporter of Hamas, as well as Hezbollah, whose militants have been exchanging fire with Israeli forces almost daily since Hamas's attack. Questions have been asked about Iran's role in the Hamas' attack, after reports said it gave the go-ahead days before. Tehran has, however, <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-67058244">denied any involvement</a>.</p>
